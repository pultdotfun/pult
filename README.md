## Fix The Feed

Algorithmic feeds are the first at scale misaligned AIs. Using Predictive Update Learning Tensors (PULT), we're building better recommendation systems by analyzing diverse user data.

## Our Approach

PULT processes real time engagement data to understand genuine user interests, moving beyond simple engagement metrics that often lead to misaligned content recommendations.

### Key Innovations

Real time engagement analysis beyond surface metrics
Multi dimensional user interest mapping
Transparent scoring system
Alignment focused recommendations

## Technical Implementation

Built with modern technologies focusing on real time processing and scalability:

FastAPI for high performance API endpoints
WebSockets for live score updates
Advanced analytics for engagement patterns
Comprehensive monitoring system
